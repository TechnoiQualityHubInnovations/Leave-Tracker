 # Application Frontend Development Overview
 ## Landing Page 
 
 The frontend of the Leave Tracker application is designed with a user-centric approach, providing a simple and intuitive interface for employees to manage their leave     requests, view company holidays, and track their leave balances. 
  
- The landing page for the Leave Tracker application presents users with two options: to login as a regular user or to login as a privileged user. Regular users can access the application to manage their own leave requests, view company holidays, and track their leave balances. Privileged users, on the other hand, have additional access and permissions to manage leave requests for their team members, view team member availability, and generate reports on employee leave and attendance.

- Both options are easily accessible on the landing page, with clear and concise labels to guide users to the appropriate login page. Users can simply click on the option that corresponds to their role to access the relevant login page and begin using the application.

- Upon logging in to the Leave Tracker application, users are presented with a personalized dashboard that includes three main components: My Requests, My Leave Balance, and Company Holidays and option for users to Logout

 -  The My Requests component provides users with an overview of their leave requests, displaying the status of each request and allowing users to view details and         history for each request. Users can also submit new leave requests directly from this component.

 -  The My Leave Balance component shows users their current leave balance, including the number of days taken and remaining, and any adjustments or accruals. This        information helps users plan their leave requests more effectively and avoid overbooking or exceeding their allotted leave.
 
 -  The Company Holidays component displays a calendar of company holidays and other important dates, providing users with a clear overview of when the company is         closed and when they can plan their leave around these dates.

The Leave Tracker application also features a "New Request" button on the dashboard, which is enabled by default upon login. This button allows users to quickly and easily submit a new leave request, without having to navigate to a separate page or menu.

Clicking on the "New Request" button brings up a form where users can select the type of leave they want to request, specify the start and end dates, and provide any additional details or comments. Once the request is submitted, it is automatically added to the user's list of requests in the My Requests component
